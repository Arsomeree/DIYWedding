        <p>When your evening guests arrive they might not have eaten have you considered food for them.<br>
          I can highly reccomend cacciatores food fired pizza! They are extremely professional and put you at ease with their organisation. <br>
          Their set up includes an actual clay pizza oven on a horsebox and a tent set up with pizzas laid out with labels.<br>
        They cater for vegans and veggie which was a bonus and you can customise you pizza. <br>
         We had a custom wedding named pizza where we hand picked the ingredients that went on it! <p>

    <p>It has toilets on site and you can rent a marquee, chairs, tables and the dance floor from here or organise your own.</p>
    <p>There is also accomedation with a house sleeping 10 people and yurts to sleep another 10 people</p>

      <h2><br> Want a classy Venue?</h2>
      <p>If you can afford it Hedingham Castle is a stunning venue. I highly reccomend it. You can also opt to add optional extras, we chose to have owls as our ring bearer!
         We loved this venue but it couldn't provide the flexibility we wanted such as supply our own drink and food and no garden games were allowed. So we decided to have this as our 
        morning venue where the ceremony took place and in the afternoon moved to suffolk retreats.</p>
